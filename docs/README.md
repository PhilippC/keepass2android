# What is Keepass2Android?
Keepass2Android is a password manager app. It allows to store and retrieve passwords and other sensitive information in a file called "database", secured with a strong key.
The password database file can be synchronized across different devices. This works best using one of the built-in cloud storage options, but can also be performed with third-party apps. Keepass2Android is compatible with KeePass 2.x and KeepassXC on PCs as well as many other KeePass ports for a variety of platforms.
