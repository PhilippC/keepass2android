# What data is collected?

The contents of your password database is yours and is never collected by us. Keepass2Android stores this data on a location chosen by the user and encrypted in the Keepass database format. The app author does not have any access, neither to the files nor the contents. Depending on the user's choice of the storage location, the files may be stored on third-party servers like Dropbox or Google Drive. 

Keepass2Android does not collect personal identifiable information. For debugging purposes, the user may activate creating a debug log. This collects data inside the app and is not accessible to any other app nor the author of the app, unless the user explicitly sends the debug log to the author. Debug logs usually do not contain personal identifiable information, except if such information is part of file or folder names. Debug logs will not be shared with third parties unless explicitly authorized by the sender.
