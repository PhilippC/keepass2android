# What data is collected?

The contents of your password database is yours and is never collected by us. Keepass2Android stores this data on a location chosen by the user and encrypted in the Keepass database format. The app author does not have any access, neither to the files nor the contents. Depending on the user's choice of the storage location, the files may be stored on third-party servers like Dropbox or Google Drive. 

Keepass2Android does not collect personal identifiable information. For debugging purposes, the user may activate creating a debug log. This collects data inside the app and is not accessible to any other app nor the author of the app, unless the user explicitly sends the debug log to the author. Debug logs usually do not contain personal identifiable information, except if such information is part of file or folder names. Debug logs will not be shared with third parties unless explicitly authorized by the sender.

# What Android permissions are required?

* **Internet** (Keepass2Android regular only): Required to allow the user to read/store password databases or key files on remote locations, e.g. Dropbox or via WebDav.
* **Contacts/Accounts** (Keepass2Android regular only): Required by the Google Drive SDK. If you want to access files on Google Drive, you are prompted to select one of the Google Accounts on your phone to use. The permission is required to query the list of Google accounts on the device. Keepass2Android does not access your personal contacts.
* **Storage**: Required to allow the user to read/store password databases or key files on the device locally.
* **Fingerprint/Biometric**: Required if you want to use biometric unlock.
* **Vibrate**: Required by the built-in keyboard (vibrate on key press)
* **Camera**: Required for scanning OTP QR Codes
* **Foreground service**: Required to keep the app alive for QuickUnlock (so you don't need to enter your full master password repeatedly)
