  This example converts the constants Fragment_id, Fragment_name,
  and Fragment_tag from android.support.v4.app.FragmentActivity.FragmentTag
  to an enum called Android.Support.V4.App.FragmentTagType with values
  Id, Name, and Tag.
  
  <type enum-type="Android\Support\V4\App\FragmentTagType" java-class="android/support/v4/app/FragmentActivity$FragmentTag">
    <member enum="Id" java="Fragment_id" value="1" />
    <member enum="Name" java="Fragment_name" value="0" />
    <member enum="Tag" java="Fragment_tag" value="2" />
