/**
 * Defines an iterator that operates over a <code>Map</code>.
 * <p>
 * This iterator is a special version designed for maps. It can be more
 * efficient to use this rather than an entry set iterator where the option
 * is available, and it is certainly more convenient.
 * <p>
 * A map that provides this interface may not hold the data internally using
 * Map Entry objects, thus this interface can avoid lots of object creation.
 * <p>
 * In use, this iterator iterates through the keys in the map. After each call
 * to <code>next()</code>, the <code>getValue()</code> method provides direct
 * access to the value. The value can also be set using <code>setValue()</code>.
 * <pre>
 * MapIterator it = map.mapIterator();
 * while (it.hasNext()) {
 *   Object key = it.next();
 *   Object value = it.getValue();
 *   it.setValue(newValue);
 * }
 * </pre>
